This is the first post on my blog.

I've been meaning to write more — not for an audience, really, but for myself. Engineering is a craft that benefits from articulation. When you write down your thinking, you discover what you actually know versus what you think you know.

## Why a blog?

A few reasons:

1. **Forcing function for clarity** — If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough
2. **Building in public** — There's something valuable about showing your work, even the messy parts
3. **A note to my future self** — Half of what I write here is documentation I'll reference later

## What to expect

Engineering thoughts. System design. Debugging war stories. Occasional opinions on tools and practices.

Some posts will be polished. Others will be rough sketches — thinking out loud.

```typescript
// The vibe
const post = {
  polish: "variable",
  honesty: "high",
  frequency: "when I have something to say"
};
```

Let's see where this goes.
