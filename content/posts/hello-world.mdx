this is the first post on my blog.

i've been meaning to write more. not for an audience, really, but for myself. engineering is a craft that benefits from articulation. when you write down your thinking, you discover what you actually know versus what you think you know.

## why a blog?

a few reasons:

1. **forcing function for clarity.** if i can't explain it simply, i don't understand it well enough
2. **building in public.** there's something valuable about showing your work, even the messy parts
3. **a note to my future self.** half of what i write here is documentation i'll reference later

## what to expect

engineering thoughts. system design. debugging war stories. occasional opinions on tools and practices.

some posts will be polished. others will be rough sketches.. thinking out loud.

```typescript
// the vibe
const post = {
  polish: "variable",
  honesty: "high",
  frequency: "when i have something to say"
};
```

let's see where this goes.
