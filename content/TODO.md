# Blog Content TODO

## Published

- [x] **Hello World** — `/posts/hello-world` — Intro post, why I'm writing
- [x] **AI Coding Workflow Overview** — `/posts/ai-coding-workflow` — The full system, hub for deep dives
- [x] **Multi-LLM Plan Critique** — `/posts/multi-llm-plan-critique` — Gemini + Codex hook system
- [x] **Test-First Enforcement** — `/posts/test-first-enforcement` — Bash validator, blocking plans without tests

## In Progress

- [ ] **Vibecheck** — Staying on course, verifying implementation matches plan

## Ideas (Not Started)

### AI Coding Series
- [ ] **User Stories for AI** — How I write user stories that work well with LLMs
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria That Actually Work** — Making them testable and specific
- [ ] **When AI Drifts** — War stories of scope creep and how I caught it
- [ ] **Debugging the Hook System** — The journey from JSON responses to exit codes
- [ ] **Why Multiple Models** — When Gemini and Codex disagree, who's right?

### Claude Code Specific
- [ ] **Claude Code Hooks Deep Dive** — Full reference on PostToolUse, matchers, etc.
- [ ] **My Claude Code Setup** — settings.json, permissions, MCP servers
- [ ] **CLAUDE.md Files** — What to put in them, examples from real projects

### Engineering
- [ ] **Test-First vs Test-After with AI** — Does TDD still matter when AI writes code?
- [ ] **Code Review When AI Writes Code** — What to look for, what's different
- [ ] **Prompting is Not Engineering** — Why workflow matters more than prompts

### Tools
- [ ] **OpenCode + OpenRouter** — Running Gemini from the terminal
- [ ] **Codex CLI** — OpenAI's coding agent, when to use it
- [ ] **Terminal-First AI Workflow** — Why I don't use chat UIs for coding

## Notes

- Posts should backlink to each other
- Overview posts link to deep dives
- Deep dives link back to overview
- Use Mermaid for workflows, GIFs for vibes
- Messy > polished, but not convoluted
